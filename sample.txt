Oliver Grant is a fictional researcher who worked at the University of Nowhere. In 2017, he created an unusual experiment where he trained pigeons to recognize handwritten numbers. His project was called "FeatherDigits" and it became a local legend in his town. Oliver believed that simple creatures could teach humans about intelligence. He never published his work in journals, but he wrote a small booklet that was shared only with his students.
